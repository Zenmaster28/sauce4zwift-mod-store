                "notes": "version 1.7.9\n- clicking on a segment name on the route elevation profile will open a window with segment details and a list of your times through it in the last 90 days\n- segment names on the route profile can be displayed top to bottom rather than the default bottom to top\n- the lap data window has a new option to auto-lap based on power ranges.  You can set a low and high threshold which gives 3 ranges (below low, between low and high and above high).  If power transitions from one range to another, a lap is triggered.\n- points leaderboard should score ties properly\n- points leaderboard has an option to make certain riders sticky so they are always visible.  You can set it for yourself, teammates or marked riders.  Sticky riders will show at the bottom of the window if they aren't visible in the list.\n- points leaderboard now has the ability to assign people to teams and show team scores.  This is still a work in progress.  I really wasn't sure how best to implement it and I'm not sold on what I've done but here you go.  To configure teams, there is a new button on the points leaderboard header.  In the window that opens up you can create/delete teams.  Assign/remove people to a team from an event signup list or by zwift id.\n"
