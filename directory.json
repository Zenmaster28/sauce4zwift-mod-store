To use this, enter zwift ids separated by commas.  You can also give them a nickname to display rather than their Zwift name by putting a space after the zwift id and then the nickname.  For example: '123456 Arend, 654321 Tadej, 987654, 234567' will show the nickname Arend and Tadej for the first two while the other two will show their Zwift name.\n- some display adjustments to the custom route creator to make it easier to see which route to start Zwift with\n- adds an option to save a custom route to a .json file for backup/sharing.  Option to open a .json file as well\n- fixes various issues with Sauce 2.10-alpha.12\n"
